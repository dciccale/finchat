*   What percentage of total revenue comes from discount codes or community discounts?
*   How does our Average Order Value (AOV) trend over time, and whatâ€™s the expected peak month or year?

### ðŸŸ  Intermediate, Multi-Tab Cross-Referencing

*   How efficient is our marketing spend over time â€” i.e., whatâ€™s the CAC payback period and how does it align with the repeat customer rate?

*   How aligned are forecasted headcount increases with revenue growth â€” are we maintaining or losing productivity per employee?
